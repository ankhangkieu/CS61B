All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I only use 1 pointer (first) instead of 2 (first and last). I think my code is short and clean.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would be more careful on writing the resize function since it took the most time for me to fix bugs.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I should make the constructor easier to read by assigning the next and prev pointer after constructing.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: My code is short and clean.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: mentioned above in first question.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I think it's good, however, it includes kinda personal opinion more than a general idea of the project.
